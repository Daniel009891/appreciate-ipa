            <h2>IPA..Whats all the fuss about? <i class="fas fa-beer"></i></h2>
            <p>India pale ale was well known as early as 1815, but gained popularity in the British domestic market
                sometime before
                then. By World War I, IPA in Britain had diverged into two styles, the premium bottled IPAs of around
                1.065
                specific gravity and cask-conditioned draught IPAs which were among the weakest beers on the bar. For
                instance Bass was
                1.065 OG and 6.4% ABV, but in 1912 Whitbread's draught IPA was 1.049 and less than 5% ABV, at a time
                when the average
                British beer was 1.055. Like all British beers, their strength declined during World War I and by 1923
                Bass was
                1.055 and Whitbread IPA was a bottled beer of 1.036 and 3.7% (compared to their standard X Mild at 1.042
                and their
                draught bitter at 1.042). Greene King IPA (3.7%) and Charles Wells Eagle IPA (3.6%) are examples of IPAs
                in this
                tradition.</p>


            <p> White Shield is an example of a historic India Pale Ale, first brewed in 1829 principally for export to
                the British Empire. By the 1960s White Shield had become a cult drink brewed in small quantities for a
                dedicated
                following, but it found renewed popularity in the early 1970s when the demand for real ale grew in the
                UK.
            </p>

            <p>The revival of IPA in modern times dates to a seminar on Burton pale ales organised by publican Mark
                Dorber at his pub,
                the White Horse, Parson's Green, in 1990. That led to a pale ale festival in 1992 and an IPA festival in
                1993, for which
                Bass brewed a 7.2% beer inspired by Bass Continental, originally brewed for the Belgian market before
                World War II and
                based on Bass recipes going back to the 1850s. Dorber and Roger Protz then organised an IPA conference
                in 1994 at
                Whitbread's brewery in London, attended by brewers from both sides of the Atlantic. The influence of
                this meeting
                persists, for instance Brooklyn Brewery's East India IPA is based on the beer that Garrett Oliver took
                there.
            </p>

            <p>In the 21st century, US-influenced IPA is one of the most popular beer styles in the UK. In 2019,
                Brewdog's Punk IPA
                was the country's best selling craft beer in the on-trade and Swannay's Muckle IPA won overall craft keg
                gold in
                SIBA's Independent Beer Awards.</p>
