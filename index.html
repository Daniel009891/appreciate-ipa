            <h2>IPA..Whats all the fuss about?</h2>
            <p>India pale ale was well known as early as 1815, but gained popularity in the British domestic market sometime before
            then. By World War I, IPA in Britain had diverged into two styles, the premium bottled IPAs of around 1.065
            specific gravity and cask-conditioned draught IPAs which were among the weakest beers on the bar. For instance Bass was
            1.065 OG and 6.4% ABV, but in 1912 Whitbread's draught IPA was 1.049 and less than 5% ABV, at a time when the average
            British beer was 1.055. Like all British beers, their strength declined during World War I and by 1923 Bass was
            1.055 and Whitbread IPA was a bottled beer of 1.036 and 3.7% (compared to their standard X Mild at 1.042 and their
            draught bitter at 1.042). Greene King IPA (3.7%) and Charles Wells Eagle IPA (3.6%) are examples of IPAs in this
            tradition.</p>
            
            
            <p> White Shield is an example of a historic India Pale Ale, first brewed in 1829 principally for export to
            the British Empire. By the 1960s White Shield had become a cult drink brewed in small quantities for a dedicated
            following, but it found renewed popularity in the early 1970s when the demand for real ale grew in the UK.
            </p>
            
            <p>The revival of IPA in modern times dates to a seminar on Burton pale ales organised by publican Mark Dorber at his pub,
            the White Horse, Parson's Green, in 1990. That led to a pale ale festival in 1992 and an IPA festival in 1993, for which
            Bass brewed a 7.2% beer inspired by Bass Continental, originally brewed for the Belgian market before World War II and
            based on Bass recipes going back to the 1850s. Dorber and Roger Protz then organised an IPA conference in 1994 at
            Whitbread's brewery in London, attended by brewers from both sides of the Atlantic. The influence of this meeting
            persists, for instance Brooklyn Brewery's East India IPA is based on the beer that Garrett Oliver took there.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the 21st century, US-influenced IPA is one of the most popular beer styles in the UK. In 2019, Brewdog's Punk IPA
            was the country's best selling craft beer in the on-trade and Swannay's Muckle IPA won overall craft keg gold in
            SIBA's Independent Beer Awards.</p>
